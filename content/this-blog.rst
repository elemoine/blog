My first post to tell what I'm up to with this blog. I'll be talking
about technical stuff mostly related to my activities as a developer at
Camptocamp.

Expect me to talk about `MapFish`_ - currently my favorite project - and
its best friends `OpenLayers`_, the `gispython`_ project, and `Pylons`_.
Without these great projects, MapFish couldn't exist.

I'll also be talking about the `Spatial Data Integrator`_, an opensource
spatial ETL.

And hopefully lots of other interesting technical stuff.
